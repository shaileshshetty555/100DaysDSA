An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Possible Answer: 2
Generated Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3,4}
Possible Answer: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 (at index 1) is the 
peak element as it is greater than 
its only neighbour element 3.
If 2 is returned then the generated output will be 1 else 0.
 

Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the function peakElement() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and return the index of any one of its peak elements.

Can you solve the problem in expected time complexity?

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
1 â‰¤ A[] â‰¤ 106




Code in Python:
# your task is to complete this function
# function should return index to the any valid peak element
class Solution:   
    
    def peakElement(self,arr, n):
        if (n == 1) :
            return 0
        if (arr[0] >= arr[1]) :
            return 0
        if (arr[n - 1] >= arr[n - 2]) :
            return n - 1
   
    # check for every other element
        for i in range(1, n - 1) :
   
        # check if the neighbors are smaller
            if (arr[i] >= arr[i - 1] and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]) :
                return i
